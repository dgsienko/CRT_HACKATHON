Team Name: Sample Square


Description: A potential music software/plug-in that creates a synthesizer out of clusters of potentially thousands of samples. The samples are clustered based on similar parameter values determined by Spotify musical analysis, allowing for a user-controlled exploration of a 2-D space populated with the samples. The user's choice of location within this space accepts the closest neighboring samples and, in theory, creates new tones and sounds utilizing a recombination of the sample's fundamental frquencies.
